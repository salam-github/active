## Parallel Scanning

Use threading or asynchronous I/O (e.g., with asyncio) to perform scans in parallel, reducing the total scan time and potentially improving responsiveness to port response

### Error Handling

Enhance error handling to differentiate between different types of errors (e.g., network unreachable, permission denied) to provide more informative output to the user.
